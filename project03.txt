1. Author: Om Kanwar

2. Total Hours Spent on Project: 6-8

3. Project Bucks Used: 0

5. (Optional) Additional Comments:
Unsure if my indentation and whitespacing is correct throughout code, but I
believe it is.
Copied entire directory to my local PC, wrote my code, and reformatted and
added everything back into vim at the end. Then debugged code with compiler
and ran Valgrind.
